                    <li><strong>Job Info:</strong> Get details about any job, career, or profession, including roles, qualifications, skills, and more. Use keywords like "job," "career," "engineer," or "salary." Examples:<br>

                        - How many bytes are in 1024 bits?
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AI News:</strong> Stay updated with the latest news on artificial intelligence. I’ll fetch recent AI news articles for you using the GNews API. Use the "Load More News" button to see the most recent articles at any time. No need to type a query in this mode—just sit back and read the latest updates!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Type Your Query:</strong> Enter your question or request in the input field at the bottom of the screen (not applicable in AI News mode).</li>
            <li><strong>Receive a Response:</strong> Maverick will process your query and provide a detailed, actionable response in seconds. If your query doesn’t match the selected mode, I’ll guide you to ask a relevant question!</li>

        <h2>How to Prompt Effectively</h2>
        <p>
            To get the best responses from Maverick, follow these tips for crafting your prompts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Provide clear details in your query. For example, instead of "Tell me about jobs," ask "What skills are needed for a Software Engineer?"</li>
            <li><strong>Use Relevant Keywords:</strong> Include keywords that match the mode you’re in. For example:<br>
                - In **Job Info** mode, use words like "job," "career," "skills," or "salary" (e.g., "What is the salary of a Data Analyst?").<br>
                - In **Coding Questions** mode, use words like "code," "javascript," "function," or "loop" (e.g., "How to write a function in Python?").<br>
                - In **IT Calculations** mode, use words like "calculate," "convert," "binary," or "subnet" (e.g., "Convert 1010 binary to decimal").<br>
                - In **AI News** mode, no keywords are needed—just use the "Load More News" button to fetch the latest AI news.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ask One Thing at a Time:</strong> Break down complex questions into smaller parts for more accurate responses. For example, instead of "Tell me about coding and jobs," ask "How to write a loop in JavaScript?" in Coding Questions mode, then switch to Job Info mode to ask "What does a Software Engineer do?"</li>
            <li><strong>Experiment with Phrasing:</strong> If you don’t get the desired response, try rephrasing your question. For example, "Convert 1010 to decimal" can also be asked as "What is 1010 in decimal?"</li>
        </ul>
